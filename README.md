      In this project, I created a laundry management application using poo concepts, thus integrating different objects from a laundry such as: machine (of any kind), washing machine, dryer, dry cleaning machine, User, Laundry, Menu, etc. Among the poo concepts that we used are: Encapsulation by creating getters and setters, abstract classes, template classes, inheritance, upcasting, downcasting, exceptions, etc. I also used design patterns such as singleton and created an interactive menu that has different functionalities that can be accessed via keys.
