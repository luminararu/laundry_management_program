In this project, we created a laundry management application using poo concepts, thus integrating different objects from a laundry such as: machine (of any kind), washing machine, dryer, dry cleaning machine, User, Laundry, Menu, etc. Among the poo concepts that we used are: Encapsulation by creating getters and setters, abstract classes, template classes, inheritance, upcasting, downcasting, exceptions, etc. We also used design patterns such as singleton and created an interactive menu that has different functionalities that can be accessed via keys.
